# 32-bit Bidirectional Barrel Shifter in Verilog

This project implements a 32-bit bidirectional barrel shifter in Verilog and takes it all the way through the RTL to GDSII flow using the OpenLane digital backend tools and the Sky130 open-source PDK. It supports left and right shifting based on a `dir` signal.
### Why Use a Barrel Shifter?

A Barrel Shifter is a high-speed combinational circuit used for shifting or rotating bits in digital data. Unlike traditional shifters, it allows multi-bit shifts or rotations in a single operation, making it ideal for applications that demand performance.

    Performance: Enables shifting/rotation in O(1) time ‚Äî constant time ‚Äî irrespective of shift amount.

    Versatility: Can perform both logical and circular shifts, and in both directions (left/right).

    Compact Design: You can design it modularly using MUXes, making it area-efficient.

    Custom Control Logic: It‚Äôs ideal for embedding in custom instruction sets or custom accelerators.

#### Key Use Cases:
- Integrated into ALUs of CPUs and DSPs
- Bit manipulation in cryptography and network processing
- Floating-point normalization
- Efficient data encoding/decoding

Its ability to handle both left/right and logical/rotational shifts with minimal delay makes it a critical component in many digital systems.


##  Files Included
- `barrel_shifter.v` ‚Äì RTL design
- `tb_barrel_shifter.v` ‚Äì Testbench with sample inputs
- `barrel_shifter_project.vcd` ‚Äì Waveform dump for GTKWave
- `synth.ys`: Yosys script
- `barrel_shifter_synth.v`: Synthesized netlist
- `sim.vvp`: Compiled simulation
- `config.tcl`: OpenLane config file

## How to Simulate
1. Compile and simulate using Icarus Verilog:
   ```bash
   iverilog -o barrel_tb tb_barrel_shifter.v barrel_shifter.v
   vvp barrel_tb
   gtkwave barrel_shifter_project.vcd
   
2.Create a synth.ys file first:
in terminal type

read_verilog src/barrel_shifter.v

synth -top barrel_shifter

write_verilog barrel_shifter_synth.v

This does:

    read_verilog: Loads your RTL

    synth -top barrel_shifter: Synthesizes it, assumes top module is barrel_shifter

    write_verilog: Saves synthesized netlist as barrel_shifter_synth.v
    then run this
    yosys synth.ys

    remember xdot is installed, it will show a graph of your synthesized logic.

**üîπ Yosys (Synthesis Tool)**

    Input: RTL (Verilog)

    Output: Gate-level netlist (.v)

    Used in: Logic Synthesis 


**4. FLOW OF TCL SHOULD BE SET IT GIVES MAJOR STEPS AUTOMATICALLY**

   
   i.e(flow.tcl -design barrel_shifter_project)
   
Step	Stage	Description

0	Verilog Linting:	Checks syntax, structure of your .v file using Verilator.

1	Synthesis:	Converts Verilog to gate-level netlist using Yosys.

2	Floorplanning:	Places core area, macros, and IO pins.

3	Placement:	Places standard cells physically on chip.

4	Clock Tree Synthesis:	Builds clock distribution network.

5	Routing:	Connects wires between gates physically.

6	DRC/LVS: Checks	Checks layout rules (DRC) and compares layout vs netlist (LVS).

7	GDSII Generation:	Creates the final chip layout file (.gds).

8	Reports and Exports:	Generates timing, area, power, and saves final layout/netlist.

**üîπ OpenLane**

    Wrapper for entire flow (synthesis ‚Üí GDSII)

    Automates each step using:

        Yosys (synthesis)

        OpenROAD (placement, CTS, routing)

        Magic, Netgen, KLayout

    You run this inside Docker

    Used in: Almost every step post-RTL



#IN TERMINAL BASH

inside OpenLane container:
```bash
cd ~/OpenLane
make mount
Then the prompt becomes:
OpenLane Container (1.1.1):/openlane%
again bash:
cd designs/barrel_shifter_project
flow.tcl -design barrel_shifter_project
```

**üîπ Magic (Layout Tool)**

    Visual & DRC tool

    Used for:

        Viewing .def, .mag files (Step 2-5)

        Doing DRC (Design Rule Check)

    Also used to extract layout netlist for LVS


**üîπ KLayout (GDSII Viewer)**

    Viewer for .gds layout file

    Best for:

        Final layout inspection

        3D visualization (with plugin) also in floorplan

    Used in: Step 7(Final layout export)

**5.FLOORPLAN LAYOUT**
Floorplan View (Schematic / DEF)

üìç What it shows:

    Core area

    IO pins and pad locations

    Power/ground rails (VDD/VSS stripes)

    Empty rows for cells

    Macros (if any)
 üß† Purpose:

    Defines the layout boundaries and initial infrastructure (like roads and zones).

    Ensures enough space is reserved for logic, IO, and power.

**6.PLACEMENT VIEW** (Schematic / DEF)

üìç What it shows:

    All standard cells placed physically inside rows

    Cells like mux, and, or, dff, etc. are now physically placed

    Power rails and cell rows from the floorplan are still there

    No wires are routed yet
    
üß† Purpose:

    Optimizes cell locations to reduce wire length and improve performance.

    Prepares for routing.

**3. Routing View** (Schematic / DEF)
What it shows:

    All standard cells from placement remain fixed in position

    Wires are now routed between pins and cells using metal layers

    Vias (vertical connections between metal layers) are also inserted

    Tracks follow the metal1, metal2, metal3, etc. layers and via rules

Purpose:

    Establishes all physical interconnections needed for correct circuit operation

    Prepares the layout for timing checks, parasitics, and final GDS export

Routing is the step where your design becomes electrically connected ‚Äî like completing the circuit puzzle on silicon.
